# SearchIt
Borah Chong, Hannah Nichols, and Kail Walker
Professor: Peter Bui

In-class group project that involved using a SQL database to organize data and search through it. Also involved using HTML, Javascirpt, and Python to create website to run program on. The organization of the code and the skeleton were given to us, and we had to fill in the body of the program.

The README in the searchit folder contains information provided to us by the professor, and how to run the program as well.
